# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To start a program you should start a test db (json-server) - npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000, after loading you need to stop him.

Then you should start a project - npm start
